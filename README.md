# portfolio site


This is a portfolio page for some of the sites I have built at Adelaide University Bootcamp.
The site utilizes Bootstrap and jquery to dynamically add content and provide a mobile-first user friendly design. I have added the URLs for my LinkedIn and Github pages and attached a copy of my resume to the website.
